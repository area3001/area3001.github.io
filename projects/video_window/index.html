<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>The Windows</h3>
<p>Fablab Leuven wants a LED wall installed on 7 windows of approximately 60cm height by seven times 1.4m width.
  It will be mounted at the street side of the building.

<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf">WS2801 based strips with seperate clock</a> are almost double the price of the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2811.pdf">WS2811</a> based LED strips with 30 LEDs/m, 400 or 800kbps data rate. 30 LEDs/m results in 3cm spacing between rows and columns. Resulting in a display of 100 columns, each 2m in height for a total of 100 x 60 RGB pixels.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Since the LED strips are rated at 10W per meter and we'll be using 210m, we'll need atleast 2100W of power. 
The strips require a steady 5V which is available on a ATX power supply. 
Using 3 or 4 recent ATX power supplies we should be able to meet the demand of the display.
For a more energy efficient approach we can also buy dedicated 5V power supplies. 
For example, a 5V 40A power supply would cost &euro;20.
</p>

<h3>Control Hardware</h3>
<h4>Option 1</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc1769_xpr.php">LPC1769 based LPCXPRESSO board</a> as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net">Art-Net</a> slave, a PC as an Art-Net host. The LPCXPRESSO will require a small PCB for the ethernet jack and decent connections for the LED strips.</p>
<p>Every LPCXPRESSO will feed 8 different strands in parallel with each strand being 2 or 3 columns, depending on the performance. 100 columns / 8 strands of 2 columns for each LPCXPRESSO = 7 LPCXPRESSO boards required. However, we still need to calculate if the LPC1769 is capable of driving 8 strands at a time.</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>
<p>Using Raspberry Pi microprocessor boards to drive the strands by <a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_LED_Pixels">abusing the SPI interface</a>. The downside of this approach is the need for the more expensive WS2811 or LPD8806 based strips.</p>


<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>Using the ethernet interface on the LPCXPRESSO or RasPi boards to create an Art-Net interface we can decrease the cabling compared to DMX nodes for each column. 
The different strands (which can contain more than 1 row or collumn) are connected in parallel to one port of the LPCEXPRESSO or in series to the RasPi SPI interface which should simplify programming and increase performance.</p>


<h3>The Math</h3>
<p>7 times 1.4m wide columns with 42 LEDs requiring 3 bytes per LED = 126 bytes or 1008 bits. 
If we want 20 fps we will need 40kbps which translates to an IO speed of approximately 120kbps per column (as the driver does 3 I/O operations for each transmitted bit). Controlling more columns in series will require a multiple of 120kbps
