<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>The Windows</h3>
<p>Fablab Leuven wants a LED wall installed on 2 windows of approximatly 2m height by 1.5m width.</p>

<h3>Lights</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf">WS2801 with seperate clock</a> is almost double the price of the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2811.pdf">WS2811</a> based LED strips with 30 LEDs/m, 400 or 800kbps data rate. 30 LEDs/m results in 3cm spacing between rows and collumns. Resulting in a display of 100 collumns, each 2m in height for a total of 100 x 60 RGB pixels.</p>

<h3>Control Hardware</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc1769_xpr.php">LPC1769 based LPCXPRESSO board</a> as an artnet slave, a PC as an artnet host. The LPCXPRESSO will require a small PCB for the ethernet jack and decent connections for the LED strips.</p>
<p>Every LPCXPRESSO will feed 8 different strands with each strand being 2 or 3 collumns, depending on the performance. 100 collumns / 8 strands of 2 collumns for each LPCXPRESSO = 7 LPCXPRESSO boards required. However, we still need to calculate if the LPC1769 is capable of driving 8 strands at a time.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Since the LED strips are rated at 8W per meter and we'll be using 200m, we'll need 1600W of power. The strips require a steady 12V which is available on a ATX power supply. Using 3 or 4 recent ATX power supplies we should be able to meet the demand of the display.</p>
