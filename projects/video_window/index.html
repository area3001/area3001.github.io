<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>The Windows</h3>
<p>Fablab Leuven wants a LED wall installed on 7 windows of approximately 60cm height by seven times 1.4m width.
  Exact dimensions: 1.42m between each window, 14mm wide led strip.
  It will be mounted at the street side of the building. 
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf">WS2801 based strips with seperate clock</a> are almost double the price of the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2811.pdf">WS2811</a> based LED strips with 30 LEDs/m, 400 or 800kbps data rate. 30 LEDs/m results in 3cm spacing between rows and columns. Resulting in a display of 100 columns, each 2m in height for a total of 100 x 60 RGB pixels.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Since the LED strips are rated at 10W per meter and we'll be using 210m, we'll need atleast 2100W of power. 
The strips require a steady 5V which is available on a ATX power supply. 
Using 3 or 4 recent ATX power supplies we should be able to meet the demand of the display.
For a more energy efficient approach we can also buy dedicated 5V power supplies. 
For example, a 5V 40A power supply would cost &euro;20.
</p>

<h3>Control Hardware</h3>
<h4>Option 1</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc1769_xpr.php">LPC1769 based LPCXPRESSO board</a> as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net">Art-Net</a> slave, a PC as an Art-Net host. 
The LPCXPRESSO will require a small PCB for the ethernet jack and decent connections for the LED strips.</p>

<p>Every LPCXPRESSO will feed 8 different strands in parallel with each strand being 2 or 3 columns, depending on the performance. 
100 columns / 8 strands of 2 columns for each LPCXPRESSO = 7 LPCXPRESSO boards required. 
However, we still need to calculate if the LPC1769 is capable of driving 8 strands at a time.</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>
<p>Using Raspberry Pi microprocessor boards to drive the strands by <a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_LED_Pixels">abusing the SPI interface</a>. 
The downside of this approach is the need for the more expensive WS2811 or LPD8806 based strips.</p>


<h3>Software</h3>
<h4><a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA">OLA</a></h4>
<p> <a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_Raspberry_Pi">Getting OLA running on Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_LED_Pixels">interface the LEDs with the Raspberry Pi</a></p>

<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>Using the ethernet interface on the LPCXPRESSO or RasPi boards to create an Art-Net interface we can decrease the cabling compared to DMX nodes for each column. 
The different strands (which can contain more than 1 row or collumn) are connected in parallel to one port of the LPCEXPRESSO or in series to the RasPi SPI interface which should simplify programming and increase performance.</p>


<h3>The Math</h3>
<p>7 times 1.4m wide columns with 42 LEDs requiring 3 bytes per LED = 126 bytes or 1008 bits. 
If we want 20 fps we will need 40kbps which translates to an IO speed of approximately 120kbps per column (as the driver does 3 I/O operations for each transmitted bit). Controlling more columns in series will require a multiple of 120kbps
</p>
<p> Please also check out <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/open-lighting/QujGTIu3ihQ">Support for more than 170 SPI-driven pixels</a> for details on a chip-select and a software solution to the DMX 512 channel limit. Also states that the SPI could drive 2000 LEDS, that's way more than the 42*20 we need per window (making abstraction of the SW processing bottleneck btw).

<h3>Installing OLA on Raspi</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Get yourself a Raspi (shame on you if you don't have one yet!)</li>
  <li>Get yourself an SD card of at least 4GB</li>
  <li>Download the OLA image: $wget http://nomis52.net/data/raspi/raspbian-ola-0.8.28.zip</li>
  <li>Unzip the image: $unzip raspbian-ola-0.8.28.zip</li>
  <li>You should now have a *.img file to work with</li>
  <li>Install ImageWriter (or work with dd if you have it in your hands): $sudo apt-get install ImageWriter</li>
  <li>Insert your SD card in your reader</li>
  <li>umount all partitions related to the SD card: $sudo umount <look_this_up_with_mount></li>
  <li>Select your image in the left selection box</li>
  <li>Select your sd card in the right (/dev/sdx or /dev/mmcblk)</li>
  <li>Press the Write button</li>
  <li>When finished close the program, remove the card from your reader</li>
  <li>Connect your Raspi to a network with DHCP server</li>
  <li>Insert SD card in Raspi</li>
  <li>Plug in the power of your Raspi</li>
  <li>Check your DHCP server logs for the IP of th Raspi</li>
  <li>Ssh to the device: $ssh pi@192.168.x.y</li>
  <li>Passwd is 'openlighting'</li>
  <li>Remove the existing ssh keys: rm .ssh/authorized_keys</li>
  <li>Create your own ssh keys</li>
  <li>If you have a SD card larger then 4GB you can expand your filesystem: $sudo raspi-config and then choose expaned_rootfs</li>
  <li>You can now start using OLA</li>
  <li>Open Firefox and browse to the IP of your Raspi on port 9090</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using OLA</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Browse to your IP of your Raspi and port 9090</li>
  <li>Check if the SPI plugin is active</li>
  <li>The config is in /var/lib/ola/conf/ola-spi.conf on your Raspi, edit when needed with ssh and vim</li>
  <li>Edit here on which port and how many LEDs you're using</li>
  <li>On the webinterface, patch a SPI port to a Universe</li>
  <li>In the RDM tab you can configure the type of LED module and start address</li>
  
  <li>Install glediator to control your LEDs via Artnet</li>
  <li>Download Glediator</li>
  <li>Extract the zip file</li>
  <li>Glediator is in the dist folder: $cd dist</li>
  <li>Run Glediator: java -jar "Glediator.jar"</li>
  <li>Select preferences in Glediator</li>
  <li>Select output I tab</li>
  <li>Select Artnet as Output Mode</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Start playing and enjoy your LED show!</li>
</ul>
