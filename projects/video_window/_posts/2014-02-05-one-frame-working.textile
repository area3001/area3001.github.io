title: Finally a fully working frame 
---

<p> We pumped up the speed to a theoretical 400 frames / sec (for 940 LEDS * three colors) with a home-brew C-program (thanks Bart). You can get it on the github repo - project luzz.</p>

<p> We're now using processing for the image and video manipulation, and paho MQTT client for the MQTT communication both on the server. The client is completely C code for speed on the RPi. All code will be added to github soon of course.</p>  

<p> A video of the first working frame (needs html5 browser, mp4 | ogg provided).</p>
